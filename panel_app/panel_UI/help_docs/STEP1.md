### Welcome to the Downscaling and Indices Application!

To use this tool, you must sign in or register for an account.

## What is this tool?

This application allows you to:

- **Perform statistical downscaling of climate model data (e.g., CanDCS)**, from medium-resolution (~10 km) grids to high-resolution (~800 m) grids.
- **Compute climate indices** including extremes, durations, and threshold-based metrics for precipitation and temperature on the high-resolution data, using flexible user-selected regions and scenarios.

The workflow takes advantage of applications used in the DACCS project called "birds", which convert packages into web services:

- **Chickadee** for the downscaling process
- **Finch** for calculating climate indices

All computations are performed on-demand, and **links to download results will be emailed to you upon completion**.
